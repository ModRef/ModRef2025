ModRef 2025 is the 24th in a [series of workshops on Constraint Modelling and Reformulation](https://www-users.york.ac.uk/~af9/ModRef/) organized as part of CP 2025, the [31st International Conference on Principles and Practice of Constraint Programming](https://cp2025.a4cp.org/).
It will be held on August 11, 2025, directly preceding the CP conference. 

The importance of modelling and model reformulation is widely recognised in many domains, such as for CP, MIP, SAT, SMT and other kinds of general-purpose solvers. There has been significant research effort in recent years into modelling and model reformulation, such as automating techniques used by expert modellers, and developing tools and techniques to target multiple types of solvers from one model. 

The purpose of ModRef is to be a forum for all kinds of work in modelling, including new models or new modelling ideas for any amenable problem (whether a new application or a classic benchmark),  reformulation techniques to improve the performance of models when solved by general-purpose solvers, and automated modelling techniques, tools, and languages. We solicit original papers that contribute to the understanding of modelling or model reformulation.  

Workshop topics include:

- Application papers describing interesting problems and interesting ways to model them;
- Contributions to understanding modelling that could guide the manual or automatic formulation of models;
- Identification of the criteria that should be used in evaluating models and the design of pragmatic techniques that facilitate the choice and possible combination among alternative models;
- Design of higher-level modelling languages;
- Automatic reformulation techniques; and
- Techniques which allow automatically targeting multiple kinds of solvers from a single declarative model.

## <a name="callForPapers"></a> Call for Papers 

This year ModRef will again accept paper submissions. In addition to the presentation of research results, we especially welcome submissions of novel (ongoing) work, recent breakthroughs, future directions, and descriptions of interesting aspects of existing systems.

There are three types of paper submissions: extended abstracts (at most two pages), short papers (at most eight pages) and long papers (at most fifteen pages). References are not part of the page limit. Papers are submitted through [OpenReview](https://openreview.net/group?id=a4cp.org/CP/2025/Workshop/ModRef) as PDF files following [LIPIcs guidelines](https://submission.dagstuhl.de/series/details/5#author). There is no requirement for papers to be anonymised before submission.

We also accept (and encourage) non-traditional electronic submissions, such as interactive works/tool demonstrations. In this case, please contact the chairs to discuss the suitability of your submission for ModRef.

All submissions will be reviewed, and those that are well-written and make a worthwhile contribution to the topic of the workshop will be accepted for publication in the workshop proceedings, which will be available electronically on this website. Accepted contributions will be allowed a time slot for a presentation at the workshop.

**Automated Reasoning in Discrete Geometry: Discovery, Verification, and Symmetry**

_Abstract_: Automated reasoning tools have recently enabled breakthroughs in discrete geometry, solving long-standing open problems and providing new mathematical insights. This talk highlights three such advances. First, we resolve the empty hexagon problem, originating nearly a century ago, by proving that every set of 30 points in general position in the plane contains six points in convex position with no other point inside. The solution relies on a compact encoding and an efficient partitioning strategy that scales to thousands of cores. Second, we present a SAT- and MaxSAT-based pipeline for studying extremal configurations of convex pentagons. Our tools help discover new point configurations, guide conjectures, and verify upper and lower bounds for small instances, improving known results for n≤16. Finally, we explore a symmetry-driven approach to geometric problem solving. By encoding rotational symmetry directly into the SAT formulations, we find elegant and minimal solutions to problems such as the Erdős-Szekeres theorem and the everywhere-unbalanced-points problem. Across all cases, the synergy between automated reasoning and mathematical insight not only produces verifiable results but also enhances interpretability and aesthetic appeal.
